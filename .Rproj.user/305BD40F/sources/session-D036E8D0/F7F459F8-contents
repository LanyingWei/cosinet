\usage{
getCosi(
  exprMat,
  condition,
  genes,
  sampleNames = colnames(exprMat),
  bin = 0.1,
  dcMat = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{exprMat}{an expression matrix. The rows represent genes and
the columns represent samples.}

\item{condition}{a vector of test conditions for each samples.
There should be two conditions within this vector. The order of the vector
should match the column order of the expression matrix.}

\item{genes}{a character vector of genes to be evaluated.}

\item{sampleNames}{a character vector of sample names to calculate the
cosinet scores for.}

\item{bin}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 represent the fraction of the
bin size relative to the expression range. Binned region is used to estimate
local density of gene expression pattern, and thus the probability that a
sample's gene-pair co-expression belongs to certain group.}

\item{dcMat}{a matrix of z-scores representing differential associations
of gene expression between two conditions. See {\link{DCMat}} for more
details. This matrix, along with posDCCut and negDCCut, are used to 1. remove
gene pairs that show low level of differential co-expression, so that only
key changes in the network are accounted for; and 2. used as weights for
cosinet score calculating. Other matrix, as long as it measures the level of
differential co-expression, can also be used.}

\item{posDCCut}{a positive numeric value that serves as positive
threshold for DCMat. Genes pairs with positive DCMat values below this
threshold are not used for the calculation.}

\item{negDCCut}{a negative numeric value that serves as negative
threshold for DCMat. Genes pairs with negative DCMat values above this
threshold are not used for the calculation.}

\item{weighted}{logical indicator for weighting each gene pair by the
absolute value of corresponding dcMat score during cosinet score calculation.}

\item{pAdjCut}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the cutoff for
adjusted p-values. For each possible gene pair of the given gene sets, their
ability to distinguish between two conditions are tested using t-test.
The resulting p-values are corrected for multiple testing. Only gene pairs
with adjusted p-values smaller than "pAdjCut" are used for calculating
the final cosinet scores.}

\item{pAdjMethod}{method used for multiple testing correction. Should be one
of "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none".}

\item{threads}{number of threads used for calculation.}
}
\value{
a matrix of scores representing the final cosinet score calculated
using the given set of genes and the individual scores for each gene pair.
The larger the scores, the more likely that the sample come from the second
condition other than the first condition.
}
\description{
Calculate cosinet score for a given set of genes.
}
\details{
Calculate cosinet score for a given set of genes. Based on gene co-expression
pattern of a given gene set, cosinet scores measure the likelihood that a
sample belongs to one condition other than the other.
