}
\arguments{
\item{exprMat}{an expression matrix. The rows represent genes and
the columns represent samples.}

\item{geneX}{gene on the X axis to plot.}

\item{geneY}{gene(s) on the Y axis to plot. Can be a single gene or a gene
vector.}

\item{condition}{a vector of test conditions for each samples.
There should be two conditions within this vector. The order of the vector
should match the column order of the expression matrix.}

\item{scores}{a numeric vector of scores used to distinguish samples. The
order of the vector should match the column order of the expression matrix.}

\item{highCut}{a numeric value that serves as the upper cutoff of
"scores".}

\item{lowCut}{a numeric value that serves as the lower cutoff of
"scores".}

\item{legends}{a character vector of three legends used to distinguish
samples based on the input scores. The first represents the group having a
score lower than the "lowCut", the third the group higher than the "highCut"
and the second the rest samples.}

\item{shapes}{a integer vector indicating the three shapes used to distinguish
samples based on the input scores. The first for the group having a
score lower than the "lowCut", the third the group higher than the "highCut"
and the second the rest samples.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 for point transparancy.}

\item{size}{a numeric value that represents the size of points and outlines.}

\item{palette}{the color palette to be used for coloring or filling by
conditions. See \code{ggpubr::ggscatter} for more details.}

\item{add}{allowed values are one of "none", "reg.line" (for adding linear
regression line) or "loess" (for adding local regression fitting).}

\item{addCorStat}{logical indicator of adding correlation coefficients with
p-values to the scatter plot or not.}

\item{method}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient
is to be computed. One of "spearman" (default) or "pearson".}

\item{seperate}{logical indicator for separating the plot by condition.}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to \code{ggpubr::ggscatter}.}

\value{

\description{
Plot gene pair expression scatter plot.
}
\details{
Plot gene pair expression scatter plot to show gene co-expression patterns
of different conditions. Point colors represent different conditions. An
input score can be given to distinguish samples using different point shapes.
}
\examples{

# get expression data
data(exprBC)
# get sample information
data(samplesBC)
# get ER status
condition <- rep(NA, nrow(samplesBC))
condition[samplesBC$er_status \%in\% 0] <- "ER-Negative"
condition[samplesBC$er_status \%in\% 1] <- "ER-Positive"

# expression scatter plot
scatterCorPlot(exprMat = exprBC,
               geneX = "ZNF521",
               geneY = "BICC1",
               condition = condition,
               seperate = TRUE,
               label.y = 4)
