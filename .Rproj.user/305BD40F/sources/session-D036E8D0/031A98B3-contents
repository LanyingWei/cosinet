\title{Differential Co-expression}
\usage{
DCMat(exprMat, condition, corMethod = c("spearman", "pearson"))
}
\arguments{
\item{exprMat}{an expression matrix. The rows represent genes and
the columns represent samples.}

\item{condition}{a vector of test conditions for each samples.
There should be two conditions within this vector. The order of the vector
should match the column order of the expression matrix.}

\item{corMethod}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient
to use. One of "spearman" (default) or "pearson".}
}
\value{
a matrix of z-scores representing differential associations
of gene expression between two conditions.
}
\description{
Calculate differential co-expression using z-score method.
}
\details{
Calculate differential co-expression between two conditions using
z-score method.
Spearman's or Pearson’s correlations and Fisher’s z-transform were used to
test for a correlation difference base on gene expression matrix.
}
\examples{
# get expression data
data(exprBC)
# get sample information
data(samplesBC)

# calculate differential correlation matrix
dcMat <- DCMat(exprMat = exprBC,
               condition = samplesBC$er_status,
               corMethod = "spearman")
