\title{cosinet: Co-expression based single sample perturbation level quantification for differential co-expression networks}
\description{
Calculate cosinet score for a given set of genes. Based on gene co-expression pattern of a given gene set, cosinet scores measure the likelihood that a sample belongs to one condition other than the other.
}
\details{
This package calculates cosinet score for a given set of genes. Based on gene
co-expression pattern of a given gene set, cosinet scores measure the
likelihood that a sample belongs to one condition other than the other. To
get a set of genes that show interesting differential co-expression between
two conditions, we provide functions for z-scored based differential
correaltion analysis, followed by eigenvector centrality calculation to get a
ranked gene list for network-level differential expression. Based on this
ranking, one can further perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to get
enriched pathways, and use its core enrichment genes to run cosinet
calculation. These functions are available:
}
\section{Before GSEA}{

\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{matPreprocess}}}: Preprocess expression matrix for
co-expression analysis.
\item{\code{\link{DCMat}}}: Calculate differential co-expression using
z-score method.
\item{\code{\link{eigenCentrality}}}: Calculate eigenvector centrality
with differential co-expression matrix.
\item{\code{\link{rankPlot}}}: Draw the score and rank of gene centrality
for checking.
}

Then the resulting gene centrality scores can be used as input for GSEA using
for example \code{GSEA} function from \code{clusterProfiler}
package. And the core-enchment genes for the
interesting enriched pathways can be used to perform following analysis:

\section{After GSEA}{

\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{DCPlot}}}: Plot differential co-expression network for
a given set of genes.
\item{\code{\link{scatterCorPlot}}}: Plot gene pair expression scatter
plot to check gene co-expression patterns of different conditions.
\item{\code{\link{getCosi}}}: Calculate cosinet score for a given set of
genes.
