Description: Cosinet is designed to conduct patient-specific analysis of differential co-expression networks. It assesses the extent of network rewiring in an individual sample relative to reference conditions, in terms of differential co-expression networks. Cosinet can identify important differences in gene co-expression patterns between individual patients, and it generates scores that can be linked to clinical features or outcomes for each individual. Its primary objective is to provide a better understanding of disease mechanisms and valuable insights for personalized treatment decisions.
